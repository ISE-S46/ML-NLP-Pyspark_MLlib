Pearson Correlation Coefficient

According to Gemini :

What is it?

The Pearson correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that quantifies the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It ranges from -1 to 1:

    -1: Perfect negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases linearly)
    0: No correlation (no linear relationship between the variables)
    1: Perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other increases linearly)

How is it calculated?

The formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is quite complex, but it essentially involves:

    Calculating the means of both variables (X and Y).
    Calculating the standard deviations of both variables.
    Calculating the covariance between X and Y, which measures how much X and Y vary together.
    Dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of X and Y.

Assumptions of Pearson Correlation

    Linearity: The relationship between the variables is linear.
    Normality: Both variables are normally distributed.
    Outliers: The data should not contain extreme outliers, as they can significantly impact the correlation coefficient.

When to use Pearson Correlation

    When you want to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.
    When the data meets the assumptions of linearity, normality, and no outliers.

Example

Imagine you have a dataset of people with their heights and weights. You can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to determine if there is a linear relationship between height and weight. A positive correlation would indicate that taller people tend to weigh more.
Limitations

    Only measures linear relationships: It doesn't capture non-linear relationships between variables.
    Sensitive to outliers: Extreme values can significantly affect the correlation coefficient.

In conclusion, the Pearson correlation coefficient is a valuable tool for understanding the relationship between two continuous variables, but it's important to consider its assumptions and limitations when interpreting the results.
