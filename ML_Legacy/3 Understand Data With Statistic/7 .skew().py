'''
Skew refers to a distribution that is assumed Gaussian (normal or bell curve) that is shifted or squashed in one direction or another. Many machine learning algorithms assume a Gaussian distribution. Knowing that an attribute has a skew may allow you to perform data preparation to correct the skew and later improve the accuracy of your models.
