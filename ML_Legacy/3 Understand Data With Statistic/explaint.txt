1. Loading and Previewing Data (.head().py)
Loading Data:

    read_csv(filename, names=names, skiprows=1) reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
    Parameters:
        filename: The path to the CSV file.
        names: Specifies custom column names because the file might not include headers or you want specific column names.
        skiprows=1: Skips the first row of the file, which might contain original headers or unwanted data.
    Purpose: Often, raw data may not have headers, or you might want to rename columns for clarity. By using names, you ensure consistent column names that match your expectations.

Previewing Data:

    data.head(20) returns the first 20 rows of the DataFrame.
    Purpose: This is crucial for quickly inspecting the data structure and verifying that it loaded correctly, including checking if the data was read properly (e.g., the right number of rows and columns).

2. Checking the Shape of the Data (.shape.py)\
Data Shape:

    data.shape returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the DataFrame (rows, columns).
    Purpose: Knowing the shape of your data is critical for understanding its scale—how much data you have, and how many features (columns) you are dealing with. This can also be used to verify that data was 
    loaded as expected, especially in large datasets where misreading files can lead to significant errors.

3. Checking Data Types (.dtypes.py)
Data Types Inspection:

    data.dtypes returns the data type of each column in the DataFrame.
    Purpose: Ensuring that each column is of the expected type is vital. For instance, numeric columns should be floats or integers, while categorical columns should be objects (strings). This step helps in detecting 
    anomalies, such as a numeric column being read as an object due to missing values or unexpected characters.

4. Summarizing Data (.describe().py)
Data Summary:

    data.describe() generates summary statistics for numerical columns, including count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%).
    Purpose: This provides a quick overview of the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset’s distribution. It’s especially useful for identifying outliers (e.g., a min/max value far from the quartiles) 
    or understanding the overall spread of the data.

Display Settings:

    set_option('display.width', 100) and options.display.precision = 3 adjust the display format to make the output more readable.
    Purpose: Ensuring that the output is formatted neatly is essential for human readability, especially when dealing with large datasets or when generating reports.

5. Counting Class Distribution (Class Distribution.py)
Class Distribution:

    data.groupby('class').size() groups the data by the ‘class’ column and counts the number of occurrences in each class.
    Purpose: Understanding class distribution is crucial in classification tasks. For example, if you’re dealing with an imbalanced dataset (one class has significantly more instances than another), it could skew model 
    performance. Identifying this early allows you to take steps like resampling or using metrics that account for imbalance.

6. Calculating Correlation Matrix (Correlation.py)
Correlation Matrix:

    data.corr(method='pearson') computes the pairwise correlation of columns using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, which measures the linear relationship between two variables.
    Purpose: Understanding how variables relate to each other can be crucial for feature selection and engineering. Highly correlated variables might be redundant, or they could indicate multicollinearity, which can 
    cause issues in certain models. Low or negative correlations might suggest potential independence or an inverse relationship.

Pearson’s Method:

    Pearson’s correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 no linear relationship.
    Context: It’s important to note that Pearson’s method assumes linearity and can be misleading in cases of non-linear relationships.

7. Checking Data Skewness (.skew().py)
Skewness Calculation:

    data.skew() calculates the skewness of each column in the DataFrame.
    Purpose: Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution. A skewness close to 0 suggests a symmetric distribution, positive skew indicates a right (tail-heavy) distribution, and negative skew indicates a 
    left (tail-heavy) distribution. Understanding skewness is important for selecting the right statistical techniques or transforming data to meet model assumptions.

Context: Many statistical methods assume normality (a skewness near zero), and highly skewed data may require transformations (e.g., log transformation) to be used effectively in these models.
