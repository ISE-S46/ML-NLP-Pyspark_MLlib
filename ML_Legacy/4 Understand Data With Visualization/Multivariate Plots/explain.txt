1. Plotting the Correlation Matrix (Correlation Matrix Plot.py)
Step-by-Step Breakdown:

    Data Loading:
        read_csv(filename, names=names, skiprows=1) loads the data from the CSV file, with specified column names and skipping the first row.

    Correlation Matrix Calculation:
        data.corr() computes the correlation matrix, which shows the pairwise correlations between all the columns in the DataFrame. The values range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 
        (perfect positive correlation).

    Plotting the Correlation Matrix:
        Figure and Axis Setup:
            fig = pyplot.figure() creates a new figure.
            ax = fig.add_subplot(111) adds a subplot (single plot) to the figure. The parameters (111) mean a grid with 1 row, 1 column, and this plot occupies the 1st cell.
        Matrix Visualization:
            cax = ax.matshow(correlations, vmin=-1, vmax=1) visualizes the correlation matrix using matshow, which displays a matrix (2D array) as a heatmap.
            Color Mapping:
                The matrix values are color-coded, with vmin=-1 and vmax=1 setting the color scale to match the correlation coefficient range. This helps in easily identifying strong 
                positive (close to 1) or negative (close to -1) correlations.
            fig.colorbar(cax) adds a color bar to the plot, acting as a legend that maps the colors to correlation values.
        Ticks and Labels:
            ticks = np.arange(0,9,1) generates an array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] for the ticks, corresponding to the columns in the DataFrame.
            ax.set_xticks(ticks) and ax.set_yticks(ticks) set the position of the ticks on both axes.
            ax.set_xticklabels(names) and ax.set_yticklabels(names) set the labels on the ticks to match the column names, making it clear which variables are being compared.
        Display the Plot:
            pyplot.show() renders the plot.

Purpose and Usage:

    Why Correlation Matrix?
        A correlation matrix is crucial for understanding the relationships between different features in the dataset. It helps in identifying multicollinearity, where two or more variables are 
        highly correlated, which can lead to redundant information in predictive models.
        Visualization: Visualizing the correlation matrix makes it easier to identify strong correlations at a glance. Positive correlations appear as one color (e.g., red), and negative correlations 
        as another (e.g., blue), with the intensity reflecting the correlation strength.

2. Scatter Matrix Plot (Scatter Matrix Plot.py)
Step-by-Step Breakdown:

    Data Loading:
        read_csv(filename, names=names, skiprows=1) loads the dataset as before.

    Scatter Matrix Plot:
        scatter_matrix(data) generates a scatter matrix plot for the DataFrame.
        What is a Scatter Matrix?
            A scatter matrix (or pair plot) displays scatter plots of each pair of features in the dataset along with histograms of individual features on the diagonal.
            For example, the intersection of column A and column B will display a scatter plot of A vs. B. On the diagonal, you will see the histogram of column A itself.
        Parameters:
            scatter_matrix(data) by default plots all numerical features against each other.
            Diagonal Elements: These usually contain histograms or density plots to show the distribution of each feature.
        Display the Plot:
            pyplot.show() renders the scatter matrix.

Purpose and Usage:

    Why Scatter Matrix?
        Visual Exploration: A scatter matrix is an effective way to visually explore the relationships between multiple variables at once. It helps in identifying patterns, trends, and potential outliers.
        Correlation Insight: While a correlation matrix provides numerical values of correlations, a scatter matrix allows you to see the relationships visually, helping in understanding the nature of these 
        relationshipsâ€”whether they are linear, curvilinear, or more complex.
        Distribution Insight: The diagonal plots give a quick overview of the distribution of each variable, which is useful for identifying skewness, multimodality, or other distribution characteristics.

    Practical Application:
        Modeling: Before building predictive models, understanding how features relate to each other (e.g., which are strongly correlated, which have nonlinear relationships) can guide feature engineering and selection.
        Anomaly Detection: Scatter matrices can also help identify outliers or anomalies that might affect model performance.

Summary of Both Plots:

    Correlation Matrix: Focuses on the strength and direction of linear relationships between variables, providing a quick overview of potential multicollinearity and variable interactions.
    Scatter Matrix: Offers a more detailed and visual exploration of relationships, showing not just correlation but also the specific nature of the relationships and the distribution of individual variables.

Both plots are critical tools in the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, where the goal is to understand the data deeply before proceeding to modeling or more complex analyses.
